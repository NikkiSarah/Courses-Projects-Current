# load the olivetti faces dataset, split it into training, validation and test sets using stratified sampling

# cluster the images with k-means

# train a classifier to predict which person is represented in each image and evaluate on the validation set

# use k-means as a dimensionality reduction tool and re-train the classifier on the reduced dataset

# train a third classifier on a dataset where the reduced features are appended to the original data

# train a Gaussian mixture model and use the model to generate and visualise new faces

# modify some images and see if the model can detect the anomalies

# use PCA to perform dimensionality reduction, preserving 99% of the variance

# compute the reconstruction error for each image

# compute the reconstruction error for the modified images and plot one (of the reconstructed images)
