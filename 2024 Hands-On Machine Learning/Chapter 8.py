# train a random forest classifier, timing how long it takes, and evaluate on the test set

# use PCA to reduce the dimensionality with an explained variance of 95% and repeat

# use t-sne to reduce the dimensionality to 2 dimensions and plot the result
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# repeat with other techniques like PCA, LLE and MDS
